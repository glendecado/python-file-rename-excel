### Python File Renaming Tool with Excel Export

This Python project provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for renaming files in a selected directory, applying a user-defined prefix and suffix to each file's name, and exporting the renamed file list to an Excel file.

#### Features:
- **GUI Directory Selection**: Uses `Tkinter` to present an easy-to-use window for selecting a target directory.
- **File Renaming**: Renames all files in the selected directory, appending a prefix and suffix to each file name.
- **Excel Export**: Exports the list of renamed files to an Excel file (`renamed_files.xlsx`) within the selected directory.
- **Error Handling**: Includes basic error handling to manage potential issues during file renaming.

#### Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Tkinter (included in Python standard library)

#### Usage:
1. Run the script.
2. Select the directory where your files are located.
3. The script will automatically rename files with a given prefix and suffix.
4. The renamed file list is saved to an Excel file (`renamed_files.xlsx`) in the selected directory.
